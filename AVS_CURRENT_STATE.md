## PROJECT

**Current Campaign:** CAMP-0001 — E-commerce Campaign #001  
**Current Phase:** Step 03 — FIND  
**Objective:** Find and validate one narrow, recurring, economically meaningful problem with reachable global SMB/prosumer buyers before building.

## CURRENT STEP

**Step:** Review extracted MIE Signals from Research Run #001 and assess coverage gaps.

**Current output:** First controlled extraction produced 11 pending Signals linked to 10 source documents. These remain hypotheses for human review, not validated market opportunities.

**Success condition:** Review each Signal against its original passage and context, separate distinct seller problems from app-specific failures, preserve counterevidence, and identify targeted source gaps before clustering.

## DONE

- AVS Core Steps 01–08 and the Master Operating Flow defined.
- AVS Central Memory deployed.
- CAMP-0001 created.
- MIE architecture, data contract, schema, and human-gated promotion bridge created and tested.
- MIE Source Registry created with 8 enabled sources.
- Agno / AgentOS, Market Scout, and Crawl4AI running locally.
- Earlier end-to-end ingestion test passed.
- Market Scout model connectivity test passed through the configured OpenAI-compatible route.
- Local runtime compatibility adjustment made so custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints use Chat Completions. This code change is tested locally but not yet committed/pushed.
- MIE Research Run `MIE-CAMP-0001-RUN-001` completed and marked `VALID`.
- Verified run contains 15 distinct document records linked across 15 unique canonical URLs. Run metrics were reconciled to the stored count.
- Human QA reviewed the 14 substantive captures; excluded 1 Shopify Community “Page Not Found” capture.
- Content/provenance observations:
  - Reddit and Shopify Community posts contain firsthand workflow details, but evidence strength varies. Some are advice-seeking or exploratory prompts, not confirmed repeated pain.
  - Shopify Community summaries are platform-generated AI summaries; use original posts/replies as evidence, not the summaries.
  - Three Shopify App Store pages retain actual review text and ratings. Reviews include positive outcomes and concrete inventory-sync failures; treat them as solution-market evidence, not unbiased prevalence estimates.
  - Hacker News item is a prototype builder asking for feedback, so it is hypothesis-seeking and carries confirmation bias.
  - ECOM CPA article is commercial practitioner context and receives lower weight than firsthand accounts.
- Provenance gap: structured author and publication-date fields were null across captures, although some source-page body/metadata includes dates and author links. Do not treat fetch time as publication date.
- Run is technically ingestible and usable for controlled Signal extraction, but evidence coverage is narrow and source-concentrated. It cannot establish market prevalence, willingness to pay, or market size.
- Controlled first-pass extraction stored 11 MIE Signals from 10 source documents, all with exact passages verified against stored text and review_status=PENDING. Three record positive app outcomes as counterevidence; no Signal came from the invalid page.
- Four usable documents yielded no direct Signal in this pass: two exploratory/advice-seeking Reddit threads, the Hacker News prototype-builder prompt, and a commercial practitioner article. No clusters, AVS Opportunities, or promotions were created.

## PENDING

- Human-review the 11 pending Signals against full original post/review context and verify source identity, independence, confidence and problem scope.
- Separate inventory sync across marketplaces, Shopify-to-Shopify sync, DSers supplier sync, and refund restocking; similar keywords do not imply one shared problem.
- Identify targeted non-Shopify sources and primary buyer accounts for repeated frequency, economic impact and current spend before selecting a problem.
- Only after Signal review, decide whether clustering or another research batch is justified.

## BLOCKER

No active model-connectivity or collection blocker. Signal review and market validation are pending.

Quality limitations: one invalid capture excluded; structured author/published-date fields are missing; sources are concentrated in Shopify-related communities and app reviews; several documents are questions or promotional/commercial content rather than independent firsthand problem reports. No blocker to exploratory Signal extraction, but no basis yet for market validation or opportunity promotion.

## NEXT

Review the 11 PENDING Signals individually against the linked original passages and full context. Refine or reject weak/problem-mismatched records, then map independent source coverage and contradictions by narrowly defined workflow. If evidence remains thin, run a targeted source-diverse research batch before clustering or promoting anything.

## IMPORTANT DECISIONS / INVARIANTS

- Do not redesign AVS Core before running real campaigns.
- One experiment/week is more important than one app/week.
- AVS is the operating system; tools are replaceable.
- Supabase is the structured source of truth.
- GitHub stores technical/versioned assets, including this checkpoint.
- Google Drive stores human-readable business documents.
- MIE is the market-intelligence intake layer for Step 03, not a new AVS step.
- Agno is the current Agent runtime, not the MIE itself.
- Crawl4AI is the primary crawler.
- n8n is orchestration/integration, not memory.
- Human review gates promotion into AVS.
- Raw MIE documents/signals must not automatically become AVS Opportunities.
- Validate the problem before building a product.
- Do not add frameworks, dashboards, or Agents before real-data needs justify them.

## SESSION CLOSEOUT

At the end of an important Chat/Work session, read the latest version of this file from GitHub and update only changed sections:

- Current Phase
- Current Step
- Current Output
- DONE
- PENDING
- BLOCKER
- NEXT
- Important Decisions / Invariants

Do not rewrite stable architecture unless a deliberate decision changed.

## NEW CHAT START COMMAND

> Read the latest `AVS_CURRENT_STATE.md` from the AVS GitHub repository first.  
> Summarize Current Phase, Current Step, DONE, PENDING, BLOCKER, and NEXT.  
> Continue from NEXT.  
> Do not redesign the AVS architecture or change previously agreed decisions unless I explicitly ask.
